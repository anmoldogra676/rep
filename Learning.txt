React --> SPA , transpiling
by default only one component which is App component is being called from index.js

React --> UI library which only holds the component logic  
so it needs a way to tell that where logic should this apply to. are we working with web or mobile 
so react dom helps to actually rendering the logic in the dom with the help of virtual dom. react dom 
is what actually renders the dom 

function component -->
import component -->
export default --> same as file name 
named export --> give the other name export that part

props --> pass the data from parent to child relationship
uni directional data flow 



parent child data flow ---> 

hooks add interactivity 
useState() --> hook or function which changes dynmaically so react 
keeps track of it. state is the current state so if state changes then react rerenders the whole component
again.


state --> anything which change dynmaically


useState --> returns an array of 2 one is value and other is function
so we use array destructuring
const [word, setWord] = useState("Hello ")

There is a lifiting the state up --> so need to fix this problem

contextapi --> extract state and store the state
contextprovider -->
contextconsumer -->

context api is good

useReducer --> is good for managing the state better based on the action we can choose the useReducer.




For context api --> 
1. create a context --> it will provide two methods --> provider and consumer
root level --> we have to wrap child components under this provider --> nameofcontext.provider and pass the value 
then for using the context --> inside any children component --> use useContext Api to get the value of value of certain state 

2nd thing is useReducer hook  --> which basically helps to update the state based on some action
let's say
